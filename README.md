# Pika's edition of the Skiovox Helper. The edition where you wont ever see "pika" or "skiovox" while using it. Instead, you'll see silly cats :3 
### The helper extension for the Skiovox exploit.

I assume you know how to install, but if you dont here: 
go to extensions
turn on dev mode
load unpacked
unzip the zip
open button in the bottom right

## Differences
- this is a mix between the original skiovox and skiovox modded by Larsrot1.
- theme button becomes more relevant because you can change the color of the top panel.
- adds silly cats :3
